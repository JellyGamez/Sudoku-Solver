# Sudoku solver
This project brings together my passion for Sudoku and my eagerness to learn a new programming language. So i gave myself a challenge and went with Rust, which I was completely unfamiliar with.

## Goal
My ultimate goal is to implement general human-like techniques and eliminate the need for brute forcing, resulting in a completely logic-based and powerful solving algorithm.
